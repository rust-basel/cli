# Opensource Contribution Meetup 

Welcome to the first Rust Basel meetup focused on open source contributions!

### Teambuilding

Build a team of two or three people. 
Teams with three people might want to make sure that at least one person has some prior experience with Rust.

### Choose a project

First decide what option you want to pursue:

Options:
  - Contribute to an existing Rust Open Source Project
  - Start your own Open Source Project that integrates with Software via some Protocols or APIs
      - Open Source Software
      - Proprietary Software (Please be aware of Licenses and Terms of Service restrictions)
 

#### Solving Tickets
Make sure to first decide on the technical branch you are maybe intersted in:
 
 - Embedded
 - WebDev
 - CLI
 - GUI
 - Databases
 - ServerFrameworks
 - Blockchain

Then search what projects exitst in that area, see if there are any open tickets.
What to look out for:
 -  Tickets with Help Wanted Label
 -  Tickets with Good First Issue Label
 
#### Integrating with Projects

Normally you use some software that can be extended in some way or support interactions over some protocol or API.
Think about what software you use on a daily basis, or what software you would like to use but is missing some maybe a ui or a cli.
